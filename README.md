## Generate Witness
- Add an input.json file to the build folder

for example:

```json
{
  "value": [65,66,67,68,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256],
  "out": [81,85,74,68,82,65,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256]
}

```

- Generate the witness by running `inside build/encoder_js`

`node generate_witness.js encoder.wasm ../input.json witness.wtns`
